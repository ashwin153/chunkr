# Compress
The compression algorithm of the future.

# Git Code Standards
- Create a branch for every new feature; delete unused branches
- All merge commits must be reviewed by Ashwin
- All code must have test coverage

# Features
Compression: bits -> chunker -> regressor -> expression -> encoded/compressed expression bits
Decompression: bits -> decoded expression -> evaluator -> unchunker -> original bits

## Innovations
- Novel method of chunking bits to maintain precision using imprecise mathematical calculations (Ashwin)
- Novel method of performing genetic regression (Ashwin)
- In Progress: Novel method of performing distributed function evaluations; essentially, streaming the function evaluations so that content can be delivered faster.
- In Progress: Novel method of encoding bits to minimize space; particularly, a dynamic encoding scheme (operations that appear more frequently in the expression can have shorter codes). Essentially zipping the encoding.
- In Progress: Novel method of performing operations directly on regressed expressions; you could do integral check sums, faster database (better clustering, faster retrieval times, easier to exploit locality), implications for caching you could load similar functions into cache
- In Progress: Novel method of decoding expressions to form better and better approximations of the function over time. As more of the function is decoded, the approximation gets better and better
- In Progress: Novel method of determining optimal bit weights for unchunking (Avinash)
- In Progress: Novel method of creating a browser backed by the compression; all media requests/non-essential data is compressed down, less data use/bandwidth
- In Progress: Novel method of using the expression notation in various ways such as a "sound" version of a file
- In Progress: Novel method of using multiple curves to represent a data set; the average of the curves is taken when evaluating the function to gain a more precise answer
- In Progress: Novel method of performing digital media transfer; you could send massive files over Bluetooth

# Business Plan
- In Progress: Novel method of performing compression/storage/serving as a service; the S3 of the future
- In Progress: Withhold VC funding until profitable/necessary; maintain large stakes in the company to maximize future rewards
- In Progress: Protect algorithm with patents/papers
- In Progress: Develop alternative revenue streams
- In Progress: Develop strong accounting and financial systems; excellent companies have excellent books
- In Progress: Develop marketing materials/logos/websites/sales decks/advertisements/public relations
- In Progress: Determine equity split (http://www.geekwire.com/2011/wrong-answer-5050-calculating-cofounder-equity-split/)
